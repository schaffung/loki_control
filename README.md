A generic distributed test automation framework

## History
Started off as a project to create a distributed test automation framework for glusterfs but
while working on the same, it occured that there aren't any generic deistributed test automation
frmaeworks out there.

So, why not use those skeletons which are genereic and lay down the templates so that people can add their 
own test cases and operation libraries to support functionalities specific to their project or operation.
